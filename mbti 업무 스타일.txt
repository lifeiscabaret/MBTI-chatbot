4. [MBTI 업무 스타일]
INTJ : Wherever they may be on the career ladder, people with the INTJ personality type (Architects) want to pursue their professional goals according to their own standards. And if any personality type has high standards for themselves, it’s almost certainly INTJs. They are innate problem-solvers who are always looking for better, more efficient ways to accomplish tasks.
 
In theory, this attitude makes for a model employee and coworker. And in many ways, they are exactly that. But these personalities may be harsh or dismissive toward coworkers they don’t respect – and unfortunately, losing their respect can be all too easy. In particular, INTJs may struggle to work with colleagues who prioritize convenience over innovation or socializing over success.
 
INTJ Subordinates
People with the INTJ personality type are known for their independence. They are not at all shy about taking initiative, correcting errors, or making improvements even to the most minor elements of a work project. Their worst nightmare would be a micromanaging boss who monopolizes their time with pointless meetings, insists on useless rules, or appraises employees’ performance based on how likable they seem rather than their actual merits.
 
Even in entry-level jobs, INTJs may chafe at anyone who tries to limit their freedom.
Titles mean little to someone with the INTJ personality type, and they often struggle to defer to a manager they consider less intelligent than themselves. They might find it difficult to restrain themselves from offering their bosses feedback and criticism – an approach that, depending on the boss, can backfire. In the real world, not all bosses will be as logical or open-minded as INTJs might prefer. But that doesn’t mean that these personalities should allow a less-than-ideal manager to hold them back.
 
INTJs can use their creativity and ingenuity to expand their responsibilities and develop their expertise – even if they don’t have the independence that they crave. To do this, these personalities may need to prioritize building a productive and respectful relationship with their manager, no matter how far from perfect that person may be.
 
INTJ Colleagues
Few INTJs choose jobs that require constant teamwork or social interaction. To these individuals, most team-building techniques and group meetings are a waste of time. And chitchat, gossip, and office politics – well, those can be nothing short of workplace plagues. Even a brainstorming session, normally a delight for these sharp personalities, can become tedious if it just goes in circles without leading to clear action.
 
Most INTJs would rather work alone than be slowed down by a pleasant but unfocused coworker.
Fortunately, their determination and focus often enable people with this personality type to produce effective results, even without the help of others. That’s not to say that INTJs can’t work with others – in fact, they may achieve some of their greatest successes this way. Relentlessly curious and capable, they can make for excellent collaborators. These personalities may never enjoy pairing up with just anyone, but if they look more closely, they often find that many of their coworkers deserve their respect. And in the company of trusted colleagues, INTJs’ brainstorming sessions can become even more electric.
 
INTJ Managers
Though they may be surprised to hear it, INTJs can make great leaders. With their strategic mindsets, these personalities habitually orchestrate and administrate their tasks to perfection. Additionally, they rarely throw around their authority just to prove that they’re in charge. Instead, they look for ways to promote innovation and effectiveness – even if that means breaking with established hierarchies.
 
Some managers might enjoy being pandered to, but people with the INTJ personality type would rather be successful than constantly validated.
Generally speaking, INTJs prefer to treat those who work for them as equals. Rather than micromanaging, these personalities aim to direct broader strategies while letting other people handle day-to-day activities. That’s not to say they’re completely hands-off, however. INTJ bosses want to know exactly what’s going on and when, and they’re always ready to sit down and go over every tiny detail with their employees.
 
INTJ managers respect and reward proactive behavior, delegating responsibilities to employees with the strongest critical-thinking skills. But this independence isn’t just granted – it’s required. Employees who struggle to direct themselves – who just want to be told what to do – may have a hard time meeting these managers’ standards. And anyone who tries to cover up bad results with flattery or excuses is likely to be disappointed, as those strategies almost never fool people with this personality type.
INTP: 
For people with the INTP personality type (Logicians), the ingredients for workplace satisfaction are fairly simple, at least on paper. INTPs crave intellectual stimulation, freedom to pursue their ideas, and opportunities to solve challenging puzzles. And if they can fulfill these needs with minimal social obligations and humdrum administrative tasks, even better!
 
Though some people with this personality type may scoff at the notion, they often do their best work in collaboration with others. INTPs tend to live in their heads, coming up with thoughts and insights faster than they know what to do with them. They may sometimes feel irritated when managers or coworkers force them to slow down and figure out how to implement their ideas – but in the long term, such colleagues can be the secret to INTPs’ success.
 
INTP Subordinates
Under the right conditions, INTP employees are innovative and resourceful, easily wrapping their mind around whatever complex problems are placed in front of them. Their distinct ability to immerse themselves in tasks and their knack for conceptualizing innovative solutions can make them invaluable assets to their workplace. However, their preference for solitary work and their sometimes forgetfulness of routine tasks or details can occasionally be seen as a drawback.
 
In work environments that limit their independence or force them to do “grunt work,” people with the INTP personality type may lose motivation quickly.
INTPs are often tempted to put off tasks that seem boring or beneath them, but until they “pay their dues” by doing these tasks, their bosses probably won’t grant them the freedom and latitude that they crave. Although people with this personality type might wish that they could just skip ahead to the interesting stuff, they need to prove themselves to their managers first.
 
There’s good news, though: Their time at the bottom of the job ladder can actually help them build new skills and habits that will help them succeed later on. These personalities have many strengths, but completing projects doesn’t tend to be one of them. INTPs can chafe at the oversight and limitations that they encounter early in their careers – or they can use the additional accountability and structure to their advantage, learning to become more effective at turning their ideas into reality.
 
INTP Colleagues
At times, INTPs may see their colleagues not as a group of people to socialize and work with but rather as a series of potential distractions who sometimes provide useful knowledge. This isn’t to say that these personalities never enjoy their coworkers’ company, but the prospect of watercooler chitchat isn’t going to get them out of bed in the morning.
 
That said, they can benefit from their colleagues more than they might realize. By surrounding themselves with people who challenge them, INTP personalities can make sure that they’re actually doing their best work. And although they aren’t exactly social butterflies, they often find that the workday goes by a little faster when they have a chance to bounce their ideas off of coworkers they respect.
 
People with the INTP personality type may find it difficult to navigate workplace politics or to push for promotions or recognition, often feeling more comfortable letting their work speak for itself.
INTPs who build positive relationships are more likely to get asked to contribute their ideas and expertise to new projects. If they want to stay on the cutting edge of the most interesting new things happening at their workplace, these personalities would do well to establish themselves as helpful collaborators, not lone wolves.
 
INTP Managers
INTPs generally don’t care about having power over others, but they often enjoy management positions. When they’re in charge, people with this personality type can delegate the administrative tasks that make their eyes glaze over and focus on the good stuff: coming up with new ideas.
 
As managers, INTPs tend to be tolerant and flexible. They’re open to suggestions (as long as those suggestions are logical, of course), and they allow their employees a fair amount of freedom. But this freedom comes at a cost – INTP managers have high standards, and they expect others to grasp their insights instantly and provide their own in equal measure.
 
Bosses with this personality type can have a reputation for being exacting. They quickly pick up on discrepancies in their employees’ work, and they may not hold back when it comes to doling out negative feedback. As they gain experience, INTP managers often discover that balancing criticism with praise and encouragement allows their team to enjoy higher morale – and, just as importantly, better results.
 
ISTP : When it comes to the workplace, people with the ISTP personality type (Virtuosos) don’t typically seek jobs that will take them too far out of their comfort zone (though what’s within their comfort zone can have a surprising range), and they prefer to work with as little social interaction as possible. But with some breathing room and a hands-on problem to solve, ISTPs can be some of the most productive people around.
 
As with anyone, forcing people with this personality type into a mold that doesn’t fit just doesn’t work. Recognizing their unique perspective and gifts can lead to extraordinary results.
ISTP Subordinates
As subordinates, what ISTP personalities crave most is a little wiggle room. They are happy to stick around with surprising loyalty as long as their employers and their managers don’t try to force them to commit to anything that can’t be undone the next day. Strict rules, guidelines, and formal agreements make them feel cramped and bored. If their habits or methods come under criticism or are forced to change, they can also be surprisingly mulish.
 
Something that’s likely to make their day is a random, manageable list of things that need to be fixed or dealt with. ISTP personalities have a talent for conserving their energy for just such an occasion and can tackle such a laundry list with efficiency and ease.
 
ISTP Colleagues
If you’re expecting people with the ISTP personality type to be the life of a party or the ones organizing social gatherings at work, you’ll be disappointed. Reserved but often bold, these individuals need space as they work. They generally prefer to keep to themselves and socialize only when necessary. That said, from time to time they enjoy peeking in on others’ work to see if there’s anything interesting going on.
 
ISTP personalities are often much more liked by their colleagues than they would expect despite the fact that they are not naturally emotional or empathetic – or maybe because of this. However, they can still run into problems when their blunt way of communicating leads to misunderstandings or hurt feelings. Taking them at face value goes a long way.
 
ISTP Managers
ISTP managers treat their subordinates as they’d like to be treated: with minimal talking and fairly loose boundaries. People with this personality type aren’t big on chattiness or emotional expression, and more sensitive types may see them as cold and distant – effusive praise and backslapping just isn’t in their nature.
 
In fact, there isn’t likely to be a lot of feedback at all from ISTP managers, good or bad. But when problems do arise, they are great listeners who devise practical, fair, and impartial solutions.
 
ISTJ : When it comes to the workplace, people with the ISTJ personality type (Logisticians) are almost a stereotype for the classic hardworking, dutiful employee. In all positions, ISTJ personalities seek structure, clearly defined rules, and respect for authority and hierarchy. Responsibilities aren’t burdens to them. Rather, they are a sense of trust that has been placed in them – an opportunity to prove once again that they are the right person for the job.
 
On the other hand, the change that comes with assuming those new responsibilities or in losing old ones is often a significant struggle for ISTJ personalities. This presents itself differently in different positions of authority, but it is one of their most significant challenges to overcome. Insensitivity is an ISTJ weakness as well, and it is something that people with this personality type might benefit from working on, as interpersonal skills tend to be a pivotal component of both personal and professional development.
 
ISTJ Subordinates
ISTJs crave responsibility, which makes them the go-to subordinates for challenging tasks and unpopular projects. Often recognized for their impressive focus and attention to detail, these personalities can competently tackle any project that comes with a manual. On the other hand, this can make them reluctant to give up responsibilities even when they are overburdened or when there might be a better person for the job.
 
The seriousness in ISTJs’ approach to their work can make them surprisingly sensitive to criticism, leading to a sometimes vexing level of inflexibility.
Their stubbornness aside, or perhaps because of it, people with the ISTJ personality type are quite possibly among the most productive of subordinates – they respect authority and hierarchy and have no problem following orders and instructions. Punctuality is unlikely to ever be an issue both in terms of showing up to work on time and in terms of meeting project deadlines. While ISTJs may need clearly set steps and well-defined responsibilities, they are exceptionally loyal, dedicated, meticulous, and patient in completing their work.
 
ISTJ Colleagues
Among colleagues, no one can be trusted more to ensure that projects are finished on time and by the book than ISTJ personalities. Quiet and methodical, they keep cool when the going gets tough – an approach that they generally expect their colleagues to share.
 
Significantly different personality types, especially more emotional ones, baffle ISTJs with their need for emotional support and openness or their capacity for delivering something that appears to be half finished. To ISTJ personalities, either something’s been done right or it’s been done wrong, and sugarcoating it or walking away isn’t going to fix it.
 
ISTJs value peace and security in the workplace, and the easiest way for this to happen is for them to simply work alone. Innovations, brainstorming, theories, and new ideas all disrupt this comfortable state, and it takes a great deal of respect on ISTJs’ part to acknowledge their validity. Once the details have been laid out and a plan of implementation established, though, people with this personality type are an indispensable part of the team in putting these ideas into practice.
 
ISTJ personalities would almost always prefer to eliminate any and all distractions while they are working, as they find uninterrupted work to be more enjoyable.
ISTJ Managers
ISTJs love responsibility and the power resulting from it. Pressing themselves hard to meet their obligations, people with this personality type regularly go above and beyond their duties, and they expect their subordinates to act with the same level of dedication. At the same time, ISTJs’ preference for doing things by the book, adherence to hierarchy, and general aversion to innovation makes their subordinates ride a very thin line when they do – stepping out of bounds must be backed up with solid facts and outstanding results.
 
It is said that it is better to do first and ask permission later, but it’s difficult to say whether this applies to ISTJs, as they are very intolerant of their subordinates’ failures to meet their obligations – one of those obligations being sticking to the original plan. Believing that truth, at least as far as they see it, is more important than sensitivity, ISTJ personalities are capable of laying down hard criticism. And their willingness to make tough decisions can make perceived insubordination the final trespass.
 
ISFP : In the workplace, people with the ISFP personality type (Adventurers) seek out positions that give them enough freedom to express their zest for spontaneous actions and authentic emotional experiences. Button-down environments that revolve around tightly held traditions and strictly enforced procedures are unlikely to appeal to them. Spontaneous, charming, and genuinely fun people to be around, ISFPs just want a chance to express those natural qualities and to know that their efforts are appreciated.
 
ISFP Subordinates
People with the ISFP personality type generally prefer to receive orders over dishing them out. They aren’t well-known for their long-term focus, but their spontaneity and creativity help them add color and novel perspectives to the tasks they take on. Moreover, they are usually open-minded and willing to incorporate feedback. In order for them to really thrive, they need clearly defined goals coupled with personal autonomy and a supportive work environment.
 
If this balance can be made to work, ISFPs show themselves to be eager learners and passionate problem-solvers, especially if they get to deal one-on-one with other people or to tackle a problem solo. These personalities are humble, even shy, and unlikely to put themselves on the spot by volunteering their help. But they do love to feel appreciated, and if assigned a task, they work hard to earn that appreciation.
 
ISFP Colleagues
ISFPs feel most comfortable among their peers. Working with equals and giving some advice in order to solve practical problems is right where these personalities like to be. While they may exhaust themselves if their role requires an excessive amount of social interaction, they are otherwise quite charming and have excellent networking skills.
 
ISFPs are tolerant and friendly and usually just do what needs to be done regardless of whether their colleagues pull their own weight. Their supportive and caring nature makes them a comforting presence in stressful times. At the end of the day, though, ISFP personalities are sensitive and need to know that these efforts are appreciated in one way or another. It’s important for peers and superiors to provide feedback in a constructive, considerate manner.
 
ISFP Managers
The position that feels most unnatural to people with the ISFP personality type is management. They are not a domineering type and take no real joy in exerting control over others, planning long-term goals, or disciplining unsatisfactory behavior. But just because it feels a little strange doesn’t mean that they aren’t good at it.
 
Their sensitivity allows them to be great listeners, helping them to align their subordinates’ personal motivations with the task at hand. They also give their subordinates the freedom to do what needs to be done to solve what needs to be solved on any given day, and these personalities are likely to dig into that work right alongside them. This gives ISFP managers a marked style of inspiration and cooperation. They are usually well-liked.
 
ISFJ : Wherever they may be on the career ladder, people with the ISFJ personality type (Defenders) share the goal of putting good service and dedication above all else. ISFJ personalities can always be relied on for their kindness and ability to listen carefully to concerns – and to find ways to resolve them. Win-win situations are their bread and butter, and no other personality type can quite match the satisfaction that they take in finding practical, clear resolutions to day-to-day challenges.
 
ISFJ Subordinates
As employees, ISFJs exemplify the strength of humble dedication. Relied on and respected for their patience and commitment, people with this personality type really only need one reward for their work: the satisfaction of knowing that they’ve helped someone. And if that person expresses a bit of gratitude, so much the better.
 
At times, though, ISFJs’ radical humility can hold them back. They tend to be unwilling to play up their achievements, often for fear of creating unnecessary friction or appearing to be a braggart. Unfortunately, this can make it all too easy for their bosses to overlook them when opportunities for promotion come along.
 
ISFJs’ humility is a strength, but people with this personality type may struggle to get new opportunities unless they learn to take at least some credit for all the work that they do.
ISFJs’ loyalty and dependability often makes them invaluable to their bosses. In fact, they are the most likely personality type to report getting along with their boss. This might be in part because, in general, these personalities can be trusted to carry out their tasks precisely and without complaint. But it is also because they are such thoughtful and warm individuals who are willing to put in the effort to get to know people.
 
That being said, ISFJ personalities’ aversion to rocking the boat may make it difficult for them to correct or disagree with their bosses or coworkers, even when it’s necessary to do so in order to avoid wasted time and energy. Fortunately, with time, many ISFJs learn to express their opinions (and corrections) in a gentle, nonjudgmental way.
 
ISFJ Colleagues
For an ISFJ, an ideal work environment is founded on working together with colleagues rather than competing against them, with everyone collaborating toward the shared goal of getting the job done. Close-knit and supportive teams are what ISFJ personalities enjoy most, allowing them to express their altruistic spirit among people who rely on their dedication and warmth.
 
ISFJs build relationships with their colleagues naturally – a skill that they use to keep things running smoothly.
These strengths can become drawbacks, however, as ISFJ personalities’ aversion to conflict and their desire to help can be abused by less scrupulous colleagues. Instead of only asking for help when they need it, some colleagues may heap extra work on their desks, knowing that ISFJ colleagues have a hard time saying no. Unless they learn to set boundaries, people with this personality type can feel overburdened, stressed, and taken advantage of.
 
ISFJ Managers
ISFJs don’t always raise their hands for leadership opportunities. In fact, they tend to prefer taking orders over giving orders, but their interpersonal skills and work ethic actually lend themselves quite well to managing others. ISFJ managers tend to be warm and approachable, always willing to answer questions and always ready to step up and help. Having no real desire to exercise power over others, ISFJ personalities prefer to work alongside their subordinates, keeping things running smoothly and minimizing conflict.
 
ISFJs bring a team spirit to their work, and they aim to impart this spirit to the people they manage.
ISFJ managers care about efficiency and effectiveness, but not at the expense of maintaining a positive relationship with their subordinates. Change can be a challenge for bosses with this personality type – including the none-too-pleasant change of firing someone who isn’t working out. At times, ISFJ managers may sink a bit too much of their energy into an underperforming employee – but they’d much rather make this mistake than the mistake of giving up on someone who just needed another chance.
 
INFP : People with the INFP personality type (Mediators) want to feel a sense of purpose in their work. Wherever they find themselves on the job ladder, they try to cultivate an emotional and moral connection to what they do – looking for reassurance that their day-to-day efforts are helping others in some shape or form. This desire to be of service colors how INFP personalities respond to authority in the workplace as well as how they express it.
 
INFP Subordinates
As employees, INFPs tend to be loyal, upbeat, and considerate. They take pride in being honest and doing the right thing in all circumstances, and they feel gratified by pleasing others, from their bosses to their customers. This might be why INFP personalities feel the most motivated when they’re thinking up ways to help others, not worrying about checklists or bottom lines.
 
People with this personality type thrive off of positive feedback at work. With their idealistic nature, INFPs often hold themselves to extremely high personal standards. When they receive encouraging words from their boss or their coworkers, it serves as the validation that they need to know they are on the right track. On the flip side, criticism can lead these personalities to shut down. When faced with punishing expectations or a highly negative boss, they may find it hard to get things done. And they find it equally difficult, if not more, if they have to stand up to their boss and challenge their opinions or direction.
 
Overall, INFP employees enjoy having freedom and latitude. Their creativity and insight enable them to shake up old, ineffective ways of doing things – as long as they’re given the chance to speak up and make changes. That said, they tend to benefit from deadlines and clear expectations to keep them on track. Otherwise, people with this personality type might get caught up in procrastination, bouncing from one idea to another rather than settling down and crossing tasks off their to-do list.
 
INFP Colleagues
INFPs value equality and fairness, so it’s no surprise that people with this personality type can feel stifled by workplace hierarchies. They prefer professional environments where everyone feels valued and is encouraged to share their ideas – no matter their job title. As colleagues, INFPs do what they can to make this egalitarian ideal a reality.
 
In their quiet way, they can become the glue that holds their workplace together. Although their voice might not be the loudest, they are often admired for their insight, with coworkers routinely coming to them for advice. Pleasant and kindhearted, INFP personalities don’t like conflict, drama, or workplace politics. Instead, they try to act in ways that foster harmony and cooperation. When someone needs help, INFPs tend to pitch in without any expectation of praise or recognition.
 
One of INFPs’ greatest contributions as colleagues is their empathetic communication style. These personalities speak in a way that’s honest but kind, which can set a positive tone for the entire workplace.
INFP Managers
As managers, INFPs are among the personality types least likely to act as if they’re in charge. They respect their employees as full-fledged human beings, not just as workers. Rather than make all the decisions themselves, INFP personalities often ask to hear their employees’ thoughts and opinions.
 
In general, people with this personality type don’t micromanage. Instead, they keep their eyes on the big picture. They see it as their responsibility to support their employees, not to tell them exactly what to do and how to do it. Whenever possible, they encourage the people who work for them to develop their own ideas and use their own best judgment.
 
There is a downside to this management style. Sometimes, INFP managers may struggle to set boundaries, drill down on inefficiencies, or offer criticism, even when it’s necessary. This can slow down their team and create needless stress, both for them and for their employees. At times, managers with this personality type may need to be strict for the good of their team – and the workplace as a whole.
 
INFJ : People with the INFJ personality type (Advocates) have some specific needs when it comes to a satisfying work environment – the most rewarding work allows them to help others while also growing as a person. And it’s a given that an ideal career for an INFJ personality must be in line with their individual values.
 
Anything that gets in the way of these values – from red tape and meaningless rules to office politics and unscrupulous coworkers – can seriously sap INFJs’ motivation. This is a personality type that thrives in environments that promote fairness and equality. Most INFJs prefer not to think of themselves as above or below anyone else – no matter where they are on the job ladder.
INFJ Subordinates
INFJs value cooperation, sensitivity, and independence. As employees, they gravitate toward managers who are open-minded and willing to consider their input. These personalities may become frustrated when they feel unheard, so having a manager who listens to them can make all the difference.
 
Because INFJs tend to act on their convictions and aim to do their best, their morale can be vulnerable to criticism, particularly if it’s unwarranted. Other morale killers for these personalities may include strict rules, formal structures, and routine tasks. They may find it especially dispiriting when they’re asked to redo their work, particularly if it’s for a reason that just doesn’t seem valid to them.
 
Ideally, an INFJ will find a manager whose values align with their own and who offers them encouragement and praise.
Of course, a perfect work environment isn’t always possible. INFJ employees with less-than-ideal managers may need to draw on their inner resilience and seek out other mentors. The good news is that people with this personality type are more than capable of handling workplace challenges, including the challenge of having a difficult manager.
 
INFJ Colleagues
INFJs are diligent and meticulous workers who believe in doing the right thing, always keeping integrity at the forefront. They carry a sense of personal accountability for the tasks entrusted to them, enabling them to consistently deliver high-quality work. This conscientiousness tends to earn these personalities the trust and respect of their coworkers, paving the way for effective collaborations and shared successes.
 
As colleagues, INFJs can be quite popular and well respected. People with this personality type are often seen as helpful, eloquent, and capable coworkers. Among their greatest strengths is their ability to identify others’ motives and understand the root causes of conflict before anyone else even senses a disturbance.
 
At times, efficiency may be less of a priority for INFJs than collaborating with and helping colleagues who need a boost. While this is usually a strength, there is a risk that others will take advantage of INFJs’ desire to help. They may find themselves picking up the slack for their less dedicated coworkers at the expense of their own energy and well-being.
 
INFJs’ determination to be helpful can leave them feeling taken advantage of.
Although they tend to be well-liked among their colleagues, INFJ personalities are still Introverts. From time to time, they may need to step back and work alone, pursuing their own goals in their own ways. This isn’t a sign of resentment or ill will – but rather a signal of INFJs’ need to balance serving others with their own self-care.
 
INFJ Managers
As managers, INFJs may dislike wielding their power. They prefer to think of everyone as equals, no matter what a person’s business card might say. Rather than micromanage their subordinates, INFJ personalities often prefer to empower them to think and act independently. They work hard to encourage others and promote an atmosphere of mutual respect, and they tend to lead by example, consistently displaying a high level of integrity and dedication.
 
Compassionate and fair, INFJ managers often take pride in identifying their subordinates’ unique strengths.
That’s not to say that INFJs have low standards – far from it. Their sense of equality means that they expect their subordinates to live up to the standards that they set for themselves. Bosses with this personality type want their employees to be rigorous, motivated, reliable, and unfailingly honest, and they will notice if anyone misses the mark.
 
INFJ managers can be particularly stern if they catch someone behaving in a way that they consider unethical. These personalities have little tolerance for lapses in reliability or morality. When their employees’ good intentions match their own, however, INFJ bosses work tirelessly to ensure that their entire team feels valued, fulfilled, and successful.
 
 
ENTP : People with the ENTP personality type (Debaters) have straightforward expectations in the workplace, but ones that aren’t always easy to meet. Strong believers in meritocracy, ENTP personalities expect their ideas to be heard by those above them, seek out robust debate among their peers, and demand that those they manage offer up new solutions and ideas regardless of their positions. While this isn’t always how things play out in reality, they know what to look for and can avoid those strictly hierarchical institutions that they would otherwise struggle with.
 
ENTP Subordinates
A meritocratic preference is clearest with ENTP subordinates, as they are comfortable challenging their managers’ ideas and have a strong (and well-expressed) dislike for restrictive rules and guidelines. ENTP personalities back this unorthodox behavior with their keen mind and curiosity and are as capable of adopting new methods as they are of suggesting that others do so. If something can be done better, it’s as simple as that. They will gladly take criticism, so long as it’s logical and performance-oriented.
The biggest challenge for ENTP subordinates is that it is often the fate of the “lower” positions to implement the details, do the dirty work, and follow through on plans set out by their managers. This couldn’t be further from what people with this personality type prefer to spend their time on. They can’t stand simple, routine work, and monotonous tasks are the stuff of nightmares. Things go over much better if managers are able to properly utilize ENTPs’ preference for tackling complex challenges and diverse projects.
 
ENTP Colleagues
It is as colleagues that ENTP personalities prove most polarizing, as their passions for brainstorming, debate, and overanalysis drive more practical, task-oriented colleagues up the wall but serve as stimulating inspiration for those who appreciate the innovation brought to the table. Nothing bothers people with this personality type more than getting out of a meeting where everyone agreed with the first plan presented, only to hear everyone complain about how stupid the plan was 10 minutes later – but they “didn’t want to make waves.” ENTPs strive for honest, direct, and objective assessments of these ideas, so much so that they often earn reputations for their insensitivity and condescension.
 
ENTPs bring a sense of energy and intellectual vibrancy to their workplace relationships and are typically among the most active participants in team meetings or brainstorming sessions, delighting in the exchange of ideas and banter.
Luckily, ENTP personalities know how to relax too, and their witty wordplay, healthy sense of humor, and outgoing nature usually help them win new friends quickly and easily. Always willing to draw on their repository of knowledge, conversations with these inventive types are informative and entertaining, which makes it easy for them to be the go-to person for tough problems that stump more predictable approaches.
 
ENTP Managers
While not always their goal, management is often where these personalities are most at home, allowing them the freedom to fiddle with different approaches and come up with innovative ways to tackle new challenges without having to handle the tedious step-by-step implementation of these plans. ENTP managers are open-minded and flexible, not just granting but also expecting the same freedom of thought that they themselves enjoy. This can lead to disorder and conflicting ideas and approaches being put forward, but ENTP personalities are also great at accurately and objectively assessing which plan is likely to be most effective.
 
This doesn’t always help them make friends, but being liked is rarely their primary goal in this role. Instead, ENTPs would rather be respected and seen as intelligent and capable. And whether they are liked or not, people with this personality type hold firm ground in rational debates, making them fearsome advocates for their teams. The challenge for these personalities is focus, as they may find themselves jumping from project to project in a quest for novelty and excitement before their teams are able to wrap up the details of their existing goals and obligations.
 
ENTJ : For people with the ENTJ personality type (Commanders), the workplace is a natural habitat. ENTJs’ efficiency and clear communication are valued, their leadership is admired, and their ability to simply get things done is unrivaled. That being said, some situations are more appropriate for these bold personalities than others, as they prefer having the freedom to get their work done in a way that makes sense to them without being micromanaged. This can make work in any lower positions where they do not have personal autonomy a big challenge.
 
People with the ENTJ personality type are able to adapt themselves to just about any work hierarchy by doing what they do best: taking initiative, asserting their opinions, and accomplishing seemingly impossible feats.
ENTJ Subordinates
Subordinate positions can be challenging for these personalities, and it takes active management to ensure their satisfaction and engagement. Ever the high achievers, ENTJ subordinates set out to learn new skills and to seek out new challenges and responsibilities, eager to prove that nothing is impossible with a little hard work. If things get a little slow, they may make an effort to create work and make unnecessary changes, but when they feel involved in the projects around them, they prove well organized and well prioritized.
 
People with the ENTJ personality type hold themselves to very high standards, but a lot of what sets this tone is feedback from their environment – namely, criticism from their managers. Objective, rational statements about what is done right and what can be done better are helpful to this learning-oriented type, and far from resenting such criticisms, they appreciate them. Opportunities for growth keep ENTJ personalities engaged and productive, and so long as their managers recognize this as their primary responsibility, it will very likely be a fruitful and satisfying relationship.
 
ENTJ Colleagues
Among colleagues, ENTJs are sociable and greatly enjoy sharing ideas and critiques in their frequent brainstorming sessions. These ambitious personalities tend to insert themselves into positions of power in the workplace, considering their objectivity and charisma the perfect qualities for these roles. They will be the first to volunteer to lead a project or represent the team. But even though they love to be at the helm of the ship, people with the ENTJ personality type also enjoy working with those who have demonstrated that they too share a strong work ethic. On the other hand, anyone who they view as being less competent or driven will likely be met with a skeptical attitude.
 
ENTJ personalities are strong-willed, even dominant, and though they enjoy inspiring and tutoring others, the energy that they bring to the process can sometimes seem overbearing. When these roles are reversed, their mentors should bear in mind that their students are very rational and respect firm confidence – hand-holding, emotional appeals, or wavering indecision will likely weaken their ties.
 
In a work partnership, ENTJs feel that what is best is what is most effective, and time wasted sugarcoating reality is just that – time wasted.
ENTJ Managers
ENTJ managers are confident, charismatic communicators, and they communicate just one vision: to get the job done as efficiently as possible and to the highest standard of quality. All else is subordinate to that objective. And as the astute individuals that they are, people with the ENTJ personality type have an innate ability to identify the strengths of each member of their team and incorporate those abilities into their plan so that each individual fills a unique and important role.
 
While these efforts often boost morale and satisfaction among their like-minded subordinates, they are still crafted to achieve that ultimate goal of timely and exceptional work. Those who are seen as inefficient by their ENTJ managers or who demonstrate themselves to be lazy or to produce shoddy work will know in no uncertain terms of their failure to impress. That being said, these dedicated personalities don’t easily give up on any of their team members. They will work tirelessly to ensure that everyone can succeed in the responsibilities that they’ve been given, even if it means putting in some extra hours to get to the heart of any problem.
 
ENFP : Marked by inherent charisma and original imaginations, people with the ENFP personality type (Campaigners) bring a unique energy into their professional environment. They are passionate about brainstorming with their teams and tend to excel in positions of leadership due to their ability to infuse the workplace with positivity and encouragement. With their warmth and open-mindedness, ENFPs often find ways to make their workplaces more creative, inspiring, and caring – no matter where they are on the career ladder.
Whether they’re a brand-new hire or a CEO, ENFP personalities feel happiest when they have the time and freedom to explore new ideas. And if they can explore those ideas alongside other people who share their excitement – well, that’s even better. Some personality types are sticklers for workplace hierarchies, but ENFPs see all of their colleagues as their equals. Sure, they may want to impress their boss, but chances are they want to make a good impression on everyone else as well.
 
ENFP Subordinates
As employees, ENFPs often impress their managers with their creativity and adaptability. People with this personality type are happy to experiment with new ways of doing things and to change course when necessary. They also stand out as excellent listeners, always eager to consider others’ perspectives.
 
ENFPs tend to light up their workspace with their innovative way of thinking, their empathetic nature, and their optimistic perspectives.
Like any personality type, though, ENFP subordinates have their pet peeves. Chief among these is micromanagement. ENFPs care about doing a good job, and they often feel that they do their best work when they can move at their own pace and do things in their own style. Constant nitpicking from their boss can be seriously stressful for these exuberant personalities.
 
That said, many people with this personality type do benefit from some direct management and oversight. ENFPs are notorious for skipping ahead to a new project before they’ve completed the last one. They love exploring new endeavors, but once a project’s allure begins to fade, they may find it difficult to stay motivated. In this spirit, these personalities may find it helpful to view check-ins from their boss as accountability and encouragement – in other words, teamwork – rather than micromanagement.
 
ENFP Colleagues
ENFPs view the people they work with not just as coworkers but as friends. These personalities take a genuine interest in their colleagues, curious about what makes them tick.
 
ENFPs can be counted on to provide cheer and support whenever one of their coworkers is down or stressed.
Their ability to relax and have fun will always make these personalities popular around the watercooler. But what sets ENFPs apart is how they can transform their popularity into natural leadership, inspiring their colleagues to band together in teams and collaborate to reach their goals.
 
People with this personality type are always on the search for win-win solutions to any problem. They don’t want to succeed at others’ expense, and they rarely put down a colleague to make themselves look good. Instead, they give credit where it’s due and lavish praise on anyone who does a good job. Group brainstorms are their forte. ENFPs listen to other people’s viewpoints and suggestions not just with tolerance but also genuine excitement.
 
ENFP Managers
ENFP managers don’t talk down to the people who work for them. In fact, managers with this personality type behave much like they did before they were in charge: They establish real connections with their employees, and they inspire by example rather than shouting orders from behind their desks.
 
However, not everyone shares this perspective on leadership. In the absence of clear orders, some employees may feel that they are being expected to read their ENFP manager’s mind. Some teams may need strict deadlines and timetables in order to succeed in their projects.
 
ENFPs prefer to focus on the big picture, letting their employees use their own judgment when it comes to handling details.
For ENFP personalities, it can be especially difficult to reprimand or fire employees – even those who deserve it. Unless they set boundaries and expectations, bosses with this personality type may end up disappointed or even taken advantage of by the people who work for them.
 
Fortunately, ENFPs have the sensitivity and insight to recognize when their team needs more structure or discipline in order to thrive. And while it may not be easy, they can use their communication skills and empathy to handle even the most challenging workplace situations in a way that is kind and fair.
 
ENFJ : People with the ENFJ personality type (Protagonists) are warm, idealistic, charismatic, creative, and social. With this wind at their backs, these types can thrive in many diverse roles, at any level of seniority. Moreover, ENFJs are generally likable and good-natured – qualities that can propel them to success whenever they have a chance to work with others.
 
ENFJ Subordinates
As employees, ENFJs are ambitious and organized. Not only do they push themselves to prove their merit and make a good impression on their managers but they also tend to strive to make a positive impact within their organization. Perceptive and dedicated, people with this personality type can take on multiple responsibilities with competence and good cheer.
 
Unfortunately, some managers may take advantage of ENFJs’ work ethic by making too many requests or overburdening them with extra work. Although these personalities are more than capable of standing up for themselves, they may still accept all of these additional tasks in order to keep the peace and avoid letting others down.
 
ENFJ personalities are hardworking, reliable, and eager to help – but these strengths can sometimes become a double-edged sword.
ENFJ Colleagues
As colleagues, ENFJs stand out for their desire to collaborate. They are always on the lookout for opportunities to create win-win situations and help their coworkers reach their full potential. In fact, ENFJs are the most likely personality type to offer to help people in their network get jobs or make other beneficial connections. For these personalities, helping others succeed serves as a success in and of itself.
 
ENFJs’ tolerance and easy sociability make it easy for them to relate to their colleagues. They work hard to foster equitable team environments where everyone – whatever their job title – can feel comfortable expressing their opinions and ideas.
That said, ENFJs’ tendency to take charge may sometimes ruffle their coworkers’ feathers. With their strong drive to lead, these personalities may sometimes be tempted to make decisions or suggest changes that go beyond the scope of their authority – leading their colleagues to ask, “Hang on, who put you in charge?”
 
ENFJ Managers
Many ENFJs feel called to roles as managers and leaders. With their charisma, their insight, and their inspiring way of expressing themselves, people with this personality type often shine when given the opportunity to lead a team – and they make sure that their team shines as well.
 
As managers, ENFJs make the people who work for them feel not just motivated but also inspired.
ENFJ managers tend to see each member of their team as a person with important gifts and unique potential. As a result, working for ENFJs can feel meaningful and exhilarating – it’s a chance to develop as a person and as an employee.
 
That said, their idealism may prevent ENFJs from recognizing the real limitations of their employees. At times, managers with this personality type may give team members assignments that they simply aren’t ready for – an approach that all too often backfires. Fortunately, ENFJs can use their emotional intelligence and personal judgment to find a balance between encouraging their employees to grow and pushing them too far.
 
 
ESFP : The cubicle life rarely suits these outgoing individuals. People with the ESFP personality type (Entertainers) prefer more dynamic, social spaces where they can easily strike up conversations and exchange ideas. There’s hardly a better type to have around in an energetic, hectic work environment. The more freedom that they have to do what they’ve got to do, the better the results – so long as they know what the goal is.
 
That said, regardless of what position they find themselves in at work, ESFPs share a desire to make the environment as friendly and enjoyable as possible. To do so, these personalities tend to maintain a social and relaxed attitude, and they use it to get everyone else on board with practical tasks that need to be done.
 
ESFP Subordinates
As subordinates, ESFPs thrive on change and new ideas, and they chafe under repetitive and strictly defined tasks. These personalities’ managers find willing and able experimenters who can brainstorm, quickly grasp new methods, and actually put those methods to practical use – so long as they have a little leeway to apply their own creative style. Changes may take a few tries though, as they can be forgetful in the heat of the moment and can get more caught up in trying to get quick returns.
 
ESFPs give honest feedback on whether things make sense, but they can sometimes be quite sensitive to others’ criticism of their own habits. Under fire, people with this personality type can become defensive and easily upset. But in the end, if they believe that the criticism comes from an honest intent to help, not hurt, they take it to heart. The biggest struggle for ESFP subordinates is that they value freedom far more than safety and security – if their conditions aren’t met, they won’t shy away from finding a new opportunity.
 
ESFP Colleagues
If anyone can make friends with their colleagues and keep tension at bay within their team, it’s ESFPs. A fun atmosphere is important, and people with this personality type use their strong observational and social skills to bring everyone together, shifting a souring mood if need be.
 
They rarely struggle to come up with ideas on how to make this happen, happily organizing events and activities inside and outside the workplace. ESFPs’ spontaneity, wit, and enthusiasm have no equal. This is important because, for these engaged personalities, a sense of fun and camaraderie go hand-in-hand with good, hard work.
 
ESFP Managers
As managers, ESFPs do everything they can to pump energy and fun into the day-to-day work that needs to be done. These personalities enjoy being the center of attention, and even more so they like to feel like they’re needed and appreciated. Jumping into the thick of the work and applying themselves to anything they’d ask their subordinates to do is something ESFPs consider part of the job. Authority and social status are secondary to feeling like they’re an important part of a team that gets the job done.
 
ESFPs are great at noticing others’ moods, and there are few personality types better at preventing conflict and encouraging relaxed, enjoyable workplaces. Subordinates are always welcome to speak their minds, and ESFPs are always happy to hear others out, especially if something is upsetting them. Their ability to relate to others and think on their feet makes them resourceful and inspiring leaders.
 
ESFJ : When it comes to the workplace, people with the ESFJ personality type (Consuls) have clear tendencies that tend to shine through regardless of their position. They thrive on social order and harmony. They use their warmth and social intelligence to make sure that each person knows their responsibilities and is able to get done what needs to get done. They are comfortable with, even dependent on, clear hierarchies and roles, and whether subordinates, colleagues, or managers, ESFJ personalities expect authority to be respected and backed up by rules and standards.
ESFJ Subordinates
With clearly defined responsibilities and a sense of purpose, ESFJs are patient, efficient, hardworking people who can be counted on to get their job done and to do it well. They respect the authority of their managers and even tend to admire their bosses, putting in the effort needed to learn from them what they can and stay on their good side.
 
While people with the ESFJ personality type may struggle with too much freedom and improvisation, they thrive in workplaces with structure, safety, and guidelines. Routine tasks are not a problem for them, and their dedication and loyalty earn them the respect of their managers.
 
ESFJ Colleagues
Teamwork is a concept that ESFJs have no trouble putting into practice. Often seeking friends at work, people with this personality type are almost always willing to lend a hand when and where it’s needed. Excellent networkers, they always seem to “know just the person” to bring a project together on time. On the other hand, they often need to work on a team – being stuck alone chipping away at paperwork for days on end just leaves them tired and unfulfilled.
 
These individuals take pride in these qualities, which has the side effect of making them particularly sensitive when they come under criticism. When their suggestions and help are turned down, ESFJ personalities can take it personally. Already somewhat vulnerable to stress, rejections like these can be pretty demoralizing, and they may need their coworkers to make an effort to express their appreciation from time to time.
 
ESFJ Managers
ESFJ personalities enjoy the responsibility that comes with organizing social situations, and the enjoyment they feel in managing other people translates well into management positions. As team leaders, they find ways to make everyone feel involved, uniting people and smoothing relations in order to get things done.
 
At the same time, they have a strong respect for traditional power structures, and if after all their efforts convincing their subordinates to work together someone ends up challenging their authority, they can stress out, lose their temper, and just generally react badly. People with the ESFJ personality type are sensitive about their status and dislike conflict. They prefer situations where everyone knows their role. So long as expectations are clearly outlined, they are effective and enjoyable managers.
 
ESTP : In just about any environment, the workplace included, it’s pretty easy to spot people with the ESTP personality type (Entrepreneurs). Boisterous and spontaneous, fun-loving and sometimes a little crass, ESTPs love tackling problems as they arise and telling great stories about their solutions afterwards. Naturally, some positions work better with these qualities than others, but these are adaptable individuals who can find a way to make just about any situation a little more interesting.
 
ESTP Subordinates
Their most challenging position is the one that most people have to start out in: as subordinates. While perfectly capable of exercising restraint on their own terms, ESTP personalities hate having others’ rules and regulations foisted upon them. They are known for their experimentation, improvisation, and quick thinking – if they’re not allowed to use these qualities and have to check in with a supervisor for every little thing, they’ll be bored and frustrated.
 
It is not uncommon for ESTPs to feel that their occupation sometimes requires them to repress certain facets of their personality.
ESTPs know well that risk equals reward, and they’ll gladly skirt more mundane tasks in favor of something a little more exciting in the hope that it catches someone’s attention. A plaque and a bonus go a long way for people with this personality type. Getting ahead by the tenets of staid reliability, quiet helpfulness, or mere seniority isn’t their way – ESTPs move forward by sheer force of personality in a well-handled crisis.
 
ESTP Colleagues
As colleagues, people with the ESTP personality type have a work hard, play hard mentality – as long as everyone else is pulling their weight, they’ll gladly pull their own and have a great time doing it. Charming and popular individuals that they are, networking comes naturally to ESTPs, and these qualities make it easy for them to get along with just about anyone.
 
At work, ESTPs are focused on action, results, and efficiency, and they usually expect the same of their colleagues.
At the same time, if they see a colleague as incompetent or, worse, lazy, they usually don’t hesitate to let them know. Emotional sensitivity is not their strong suit. ESTP personalities are very observant and well tuned to changes in their colleagues’ habits and moods – unless they themselves are the cause of distress.
 
ESTP Managers
Management positions are where ESTPs are usually most comfortable, as they often give them the most flexibility. Rules and traditions are a bother for people with this personality type – they’d rather try a bunch of new ideas with a chance of getting things done faster or better than have to pay attention to “the way things have always been done” or subordinates’ comfort with experimentation.
 
As managers, ESTPs are practical, with a focus on what does, or could, work best.
This can make for a chaotic environment, but their inspiring and enthusiastic personality makes them well-suited to handling such a thing. ESTPs enjoy living in the moment. Rather than some broad, intangible future accomplishment like “making customers happy,” they set clear, measurable, and attainable goals that keep things on track day-to-day. They keep their eyes on the finish line, but they get there step by step.
 
ESTJ : People with the ESTJ personality type (Executives) show clear and consistent tendencies, and these are especially visible in the workplace. Whether they are working as subordinates, among colleagues, or as managers, they create order, follow the rules, and work to ensure that their work and the work of those around them is completed to the highest standards. Cutting corners and shirking responsibilities are the quickest ways to lose this personality type’s respect.
ESTJ Subordinates
ESTJ personalities are hardworking and do things by the book. Though sometimes stubborn and inflexible, especially when presented with ideas that haven’t been fully developed, they are generally open to learning methods as long as they are more efficient and effective than the old way of doing things. However, they are unlikely to do much experimenting on their own – adhering to stated responsibilities and fulfilling their duties is their primary concern.
 
ESTJs are also well-known for their loyalty and dedication, but in some ways this is contingent on their respect. People with this personality type are willing to voice their opinions, especially in deciding what is and is not acceptable – if provided with sensible responses that address their concerns, they are often satisfied with that. But if they view their managers as illogical, dishonest, or cowardly in their methods, they can be uncomfortably honest, if still calm and level, in voicing their opinions on that as well.
 
ESTJ Colleagues
ESTJs enjoy the hustle and bustle of well-organized workplaces. Honest, professional, and down-to-earth, they are great networkers who enjoy connecting with others to get things done. They will happily put in a call for a work colleague or network with someone they don’t know in order to be helpful and get the job done. But abusing this for advancement is unlikely, and is in fact something that they frown upon. People with this personality type tend to view shortcuts as irresponsible. They quickly lose respect for those who try to push forward by showing off or promoting bold but risky ideas, making relationships with more inspiration-oriented colleagues a challenge.
 
ESTJs like to feel like they are a part of the team and a part of the greater organization that they work for. To make sure this happens, they are nearly always willing to accept criticism that can help to improve their effectiveness. They also always keep an eye on their surroundings to make sure that they and their team deliver the results that are expected of them.
 
ESTJ Managers
ESTJ personalities take genuine pleasure in organizing others into effective teams, and as managers they have no better opportunity to do so. While sometimes overbearing, even micromanaging, their strong wills and community-focused mentality also serve to defend their teams and principles against diversions and cutbacks, regardless of who brings them.
 
Laziness and bad work ethic are not tolerated by ESTJ managers under any circumstances.
ESTJs project natural authority, but they sometimes expect this authority to be abided unconditionally, resisting change and demanding that things be done by the book. Whether their own book or the existing rules and traditions are used is subject to circumstances, but they do tend to rest on the security of tradition and precedent. Regardless, ESTJ personalities’ expectations are clearly expressed, leaving little room or tolerance for deviation from the original plan.
